# Overview

# DNS
- a decentralized naming system for computers, services, or resources connected to the internet or private networks
    - Records
        - providing information about domain names, IP addresses, mail servers, and so on
        - Each record type serves a specific purpose and is used for various DNS-related tasks
        - types
            - A (Address) Record:
                - Maps a domain or subdomain to an IPv4 address.
                - Example: example.com IN A 192.168.1.1
            - AAAA (IPv6 Address) Record:
                - Maps a domain or subdomain to an IPv6 address.
                - Example: example.com IN AAAA 2001:db8::1
            - CNAME (Canonical Name) Record:
                - Creates an alias or nickname for one domain to point to another domain.
                - Example: www.example.com IN CNAME example.com
            - MX (Mail Exchange) Record:
                - Specifies mail servers responsible for receiving emails on behalf of the domain.
                - Example: example.com IN MX 10 mailserver.example.com
            - TXT (Text) Record:
                - Stores arbitrary text data and is often used for adding human-readable information.
                - Example: example.com IN TXT "v=spf1 include:_spf.example.com ~all"
            - PTR (Pointer) Record:
                - Used for reverse DNS lookups, mapping an IP address to a domain or hostname.
                - Example: 1.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa IN PTR example.com
            - NS (Name Server) Record:
                - Specifies authoritative DNS servers for the domain.
                - Example: example.com IN NS ns1.exampledns.com
            - SOA (Start of Authority) Record:
                - Contains administrative information about the domain and the zone.
           - SRV (Service) Record:
                - Specifies information about services available in the domain.
                - Example: _service._tcp.example.com IN SRV 0 5 5060 server.example.com
            - CAA (Certification Authority Authorization) Record:
                - Controls which certificate authorities are allowed to issue certificates for a domain.
                - Example: example.com IN CAA 0 issue "letsencrypt.org"
- Domain
    - a group of network resources (such as computers, servers, or devices) that are managed under a common set of rules and procedures.
    - parent domain
        -  a higher-level domain in the DNS hierarchy. It is the domain from which one or more subdomains originate
    - subdomain
        - a domain that is part of a larger domain

# Security
- SSL
    - Secure Socket Layer
    - cryptographic protocols designed to provide secure communication over a computer network
    - used to secure data transfer between a client (such as a web browser) and a server (web server, email server, etc.)
    - developed by Netscape in the mid-1990s to secure online communication.
    - SSL 2.0 and 3.0 had security issues, leading to the deprecation of SSL in favor of TLS
- TLS
    - Transport Layer Security
    -  the successor to SSL and was designed to address the security shortcomings of SSL
    - cryptographic protocols designed to provide secure communication over a computer network
    - used to secure data transfer between a client (such as a web browser) and a server (web server, email server, etc.)
    - technical aspects
        - Handshake Protocol
            - Establishes the initial parameters of the secure communication session
            - Determines the algorithms and keys used for encryption and authentication.
            - Optionally authenticates the server (and sometimes the client) to ensure their identities
        - Record Protocol
            - Manages the encrypted communication session
            - Uses symmetric-key encryption algorithms to secure the data transmitted between the client and server
            - Employs cryptographic hash functions to ensure the integrity of the transmitted data
            - Can include data compression, though it's often recommended to disable it due to potential security issues
        - TLS Cipher Suits
            - Cipher Suite
                - A combination of encryption, hash, and key exchange algorithms
            - TLS 1.3 promotes the use of cipher suites with PFS
                - PFS
                    - Perfect Forward Secrecy
                    - ensuring that a compromise of long-term keys does not compromise past session keys.
        - 暗黙的TLS
            - 初期接続でSecure Socket LayerまたはTransport Layer Security証明書を使って開始
            - クライアント側に少し多くの作業を要求
            - 接続は最初から暗号化
        - StartTLS
            - プレーンテキストでやり取り開始し、可能であればTLSにアップグレードするプロトコルコマンド
            - １つのポートで平文とTLSの両方を扱うことができるため。利用推奨
