# Concepts
- Buffer
    - overviews:
        - a region of memory that holds a certain amount of data. It acts as a temporary storage area during I/O operations
        - Buffered I/O:
            - In buffered I/O, data is not transferred one byte at a time. Instead, it is read or written in larger chunks or blocks. The buffer is used to accumulate a certain amount of data before initiation the actuaal I/O operations
    - advantages:
        - reduced system calls
        - improved performance especially for disk or network operations 
        - minimized overhead
            - overhead:
                - any additional resources or time required by a system, process, or operation beyond the minimum necessary for its primary purpose
- Regular expressions
    - overviews:
        - powerful sequences of characters that form a search pattern. 
        - They are used for pattern matching within strings, enabling efficient and flexible text search and manipulation. 
        - Regex is a fundamental tool in various programming languages, text editors, and command-line utilities.
    - expressions:
        - Literal Characters:
            - Characters match themselves.
            - Example: abc matches the sequence "abc" in a string.
        - Metacharacters:
            - Special characters with a symbolic meaning.
            - Examples:
                - ^ (start of line), 
                - $ (end of line),
                - . (any character), 
                - \* (zero or more occurrences), 
                - \+ (one or more occurrences), 
                - ? (zero or one occurrence).
        - Character Classes:
            - Defines a set of characters.
            - Examples: 
                - [aeiou] matches any vowel, 
                - [^0-9] matches any non-digit.
        - Quantifiers:
            - Specify the number of occurrences.
            - Examples: 
            - a{3} matches exactly three 
            - 'a' characters, 
            - b{2,4} matches 2 to 4 'b' characters.
        - Anchors:
            - Define the position in the string.
            - Examples: 
            - ^ (start of line), 
            - $ (end of line), 
            - \b (word boundary).
        - Escape Characters:
            - Escaping metacharacters to match them literally.
            - Example: 
            - \. matches a period (.) character.
        - Groups and Capturing:
            - Use parentheses to group expressions and capture matched content.
            - Example: 
            - (ab)+ matches one or more occurrences of "ab".
    - use cases:
        - Validation:
            - Validate emails, phone numbers, zip codes, etc.
        - Search and Replace:
            - Find and replace text patterns in a document or code.
        - Data Extraction:
            - Extract specific information from structured data.
        - Parsing and Tokenization:
            - Break down a string into meaningful parts.
        - Filtering:
            - Filter lines or items based on specific criteria.
    - examples:
        - mail address:
            - ^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$
